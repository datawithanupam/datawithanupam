## 👋 Hello, I'm Anupam Kumar!

🎓 Mechanical Engineering Graduate | 📊 Aspiring Business Analyst | 📚 Book lover 

💡 I’m passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights to support smart business and policy decisions.  
🚀 Currently upskilling in Business Analytics at Masai School, where I wrote my first line of code and discovered the power of data.  
🔍 I enjoy exploring trends, uncovering patterns, and telling stories with data using tools like Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI.
